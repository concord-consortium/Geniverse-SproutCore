These are spec tests designed to be run using the Lebowski framework.
For information about Lebowski, see http://github.com/FrozenCanuck/Lebowski

To run these spec tests:

Make sure you have bundler installed and in your current gemset.

Run the tests (from the Geniverse-Sproutcore main folder):
  $ sh run_lebowski_tests.sh

If all works successfully, you should see Selenium run through the test(s) using your browser, and then see an output
in the console similar to

	Geniverse Test
	  will show the welcome message after login

	Finished in 1.426646 seconds

	1 example, 0 failures

You can optionally add a specific spec file as an argument to the run_lebowski_tests.sh script:
  $ sh run_lebowski_tests.sh spec/template_specs/breed_page_spec.rb
