These are spec tests designed to be run using the Lebowski framework.
For information about Lebowski, see http://github.com/FrozenCanuck/Lebowski

To run these spec tests:

Install the 'lebowski' gem
  $ gem install lebowski

Start the selenium server
  $ lebowski-start-server

Start the geniverse application
  $ cd Geniverse-SproutCore
  $ sc-server

Run the spec tests
  $ cd spec
  $ lebowski-spec -f n geniverse.rb

If all works successfully, you should see Selenium run through the test(s) using your browser, and then see an output
in the console similar to

	Geniverse Test
	  will show the welcome message after login

	Finished in 1.426646 seconds
